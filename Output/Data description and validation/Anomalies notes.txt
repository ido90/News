Invalid link titles:
Link titles (the texts associated with the links of the articles) were not scrapped in Haaretz due to complexity and low importance.

Invalid authors:
It looks like there're several possible HTML structures for the author label in Haaretz and Mako, whereas only one was parsed.
In addition, TheMarker authors within Haaretz were not scrapped at all due to slight complexity and lack of patience.

Short text length:
Most are valid (short food or religion stuff).
Few articles are administration articles ("did you find a mistake? please write to us...").
Few articles were mis-parsed due to reasons like unusual HTML labels.

Long author name:
Looks like just multiple authors.

Short titles:
Most are valid (e.g. a name of a restaurant).

Non-Hebrew/number/single-character words:
Mostly just English or hyphen ("-") or something else.
Dumbly-implemented sanity check, when I come to think about it.
Although non-Hebrew may be an interesting feature in classification later on.

Repetitions:
np.unique should have been applied on URLs per source rather than per section.
Few articles were shared by different sections, hence were duplicated.
This has been fixed.
